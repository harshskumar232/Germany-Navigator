# Germany Navigator V4 (Minimal Pages)

Pages:
- Home (`index.html`) with YouTube + Instagram sections
- Admission
- Visa
- Pre Departure
- Post Arrival

All styling is in `site.css` and scripts in `site.js`.
Images are local SVGs in `/assets` so everything works on GitHub Pages for free.

Deploy on GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → main branch / root.
